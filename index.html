                The Browser is Already a Game Engine was a 10 week course taught by Everest Pipkin with assistance from Tee Topor at School for Poetic Computation. Our class collectively addressed and offered alternatives for both game making and website making.  Working with the grain of the web, students used HTML, CSS and Javascript to explore various game mechanics, and ultimately designed playful browser based experiences. You can read Teeâ€™s reflections on the class here.

            <h1> Diorama - Andrew Boylan</h1>
        <p>Diorama is a game spun from the philosophics of Laila Smith on authenticity and intimacy. Leaking hydrants bleed childhood memories into adult reality. A phone will ring with a message not meant for you. Diorama was created in conjunction with the release of Laila's second single from her upcoming EP.</p>
